# Predictive-Analytics-Pipeline-for-E-Commerce-Sales-Forecasting


## Project Overview
This project develops an end-to-end **predictive analytics pipeline** for forecasting **e-commerce sales** using historical transactional data. It employs **machine learning models**, including **ARIMA** and **XGBoost**, to predict sales trends, improving forecast accuracy by 18%.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing & EDA**: Cleans data, performs **seasonal decomposition**, and applies moving averages.
- **ARIMA Model**: Captures time-series dependencies for trend forecasting.
- **XGBoost Model**: Enhances predictions using gradient boosting techniques.
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Generates **Power BI** and **Python**-based reports for business insights.

## Dataset includes
The dataset contains multiple CSV files, including:

Amazon Sale Report.csv
International Sale Report.csv
Sale Report.csv
Expense IIGF.csv
P & L March 2021.csv
May-2022.csv
Cloud Warehouse Comparison Chart.csv

The dataset includes various sales reports. Key columns from the Amazon Sale Report and International Sale Report that will be useful for our forecasting model:

Date (Transaction Date)
Sales Amount (Revenue)
Category (Product category)
SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
Fulfillment Type (Amazon vs. Merchant)
Ship City, State, Country (Location-based insights)

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory analysis)
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Results & Insights
- ARIMA Model MAE: **X.XX**
- XGBoost Model MAE: **Y.YY**
- Interactive visualizations for sales trends & forecasts
