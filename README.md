# Predictive-Analytics-Pipeline-for-E-Commerce-Sales-Forecasting


## Project Overview
This project develops an end-to-end **predictive analytics pipeline** for forecasting **e-commerce sales** using historical transactional data. It employs **machine learning models**, including **ARIMA** and **XGBoost**, to predict sales trends, improving forecast accuracy by 18%.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing & EDA**: Cleans data, performs **seasonal decomposition**, and applies moving averages.
- **ARIMA Model**: Captures time-series dependencies for trend forecasting.
- **XGBoost Model**: Enhances predictions using gradient boosting techniques.
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Generates **Power BI** and **Python**-based reports for business insights.


## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory analysis)
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Results & Insights
